Google Tasks backup (GTB) reuses code from Google Tasks Porter (GTP), and adds
extra functionality including;
- task state inclusion options (completed, hidden, deleted)
- additional export file formats,
- a tasks display page with multiple selection and filtering options

Whereas GTP was used a database to retrieve tasks from the Google Tasks server, 
and to store snapshots on behalf of the user, GTB retrieves tasks into memory
and then provides the user with a number of export options, inclduing various 
file formats, tasks display page, and RTM-compatible email.

The memory based approach of GTB is significantly faster, and also uses 
signicantly fewer resources than GTP. Users who report that their tasklists
were too large to be exported by GTP have been able to successfully back up
using GTB.


Unlike GTP, GTB does not import tasks. 
There is a separate project (import-tasks) which can import tasks that have
been exported by GTB, as well as specially formatted CSV files.
