This is the Django template file for Microsoft Outlook tasks.

Importing CSV into Excel in Australia was causing dates to be incorrectly interpretted, 
because the originally specified "n/j/Y" format is US-centric. 
Changed to use "j b Y" which is unambigous for both humans and machines. 
NOTE: Whilst RFC-2822 and ISO-8601 are both unambiguous, Excel cannot interpret those formats!

For reference, the ^M character in this file exists because Outlook can only import files with Windows-style line breaks.
