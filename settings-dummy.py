# Client ID and Secret values from the "API Access" page at https://code.google.com/apis/console/

# Client IDs, secrets, user-agents and host-messages are indexed by host name, 
# to allow the application to be run on different hosts, (e.g., test and production),
# without having to change these values each time.

# URL's starting with a number are the n'th version on the server. 
# The version number is specified in app.yaml
# This allows a way to test a different non-default version before making it default.
